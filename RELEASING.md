# Release to Visual Studio Marketplace

The `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` workflow tests and packages each push to
`develop`, pull request and manual run. Pushing a stable version tag such as
`v0.2.0` additionally publishes the built VSIX to Visual Studio Marketplace and
attaches the VSIX and its SHA-256 checksum to the GitHub release for that tag.

The tag must exactly match `v` followed by the version in both `package.json` and
`package-lock.json`. Builds use the locked dependencies, Node 22 and PowerShell
Core 7.6 or later on a Windows runner. CI runs the automated unit and prepared
process-graph tests; installed Desktop integration remains the separate
qualification described in `QUALIFICATION.md`.

## One-time Marketplace setup

Sign in to the [Marketplace publisher management page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/FrenchExDev).
Under publisher **FrenchExDev**, open **Trusted Publishing** and create a policy:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Provider | GitHub Actions |
| Repository owner | `FrenchExDev2` |
| Repository | `PoSh.WatchDog.PoSh` |
| Workflow | `publish.yaml` |
| Environment | `release` |

The repository owner is the GitHub organization. The extension publisher remains
`FrenchExDev`. The workflow filename includes its `.yaml` extension and is entered
without the `.github/workflows/` prefix.

Check that the policy is active and honor any activation deadline shown in the
Marketplace interface. The publishing job selects GitHub environment `release`,
which must match this policy exactly. The workflow requests
`id-token: write` and uses `vsce publish --oidc`; no Marketplace PAT or `VSCE_PAT`
repository secret is required. GitHub supplies its own `GITHUB_TOKEN` for creating
the GitHub release and uploading assets.

See the [official Trusted Publishing instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#publish-with-github-actions-and-trusted-publishing).

## Publish a version

1. Update `package.json`, the root package entries in `package-lock.json`, and
   `CHANGELOG.md`; update the qualification evidence where behavior changed.
2. Commit and push all required source, tests, assets and the workflow. Confirm
   the **Test and publish** build succeeds on the intended commit.
3. Create and push tag `v0.2.0` on that commit, or the corresponding tag for a
   later version. The tag must include the workflow and all release source files.
4. Follow the workflow in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/FrenchExDev2/PoSh.WatchDog.PoSh/actions/workflows/publish.yaml).
   A successful publish job uploads to Marketplace and creates the GitHub release
   with its assets. Reruns preserve matching assets and upload missing ones;
   conflicting existing assets fail explicitly. Marketplace validation and public availability can lag
   the accepted upload; check the extension page before announcing availability.

When the version has already been uploaded manually, `--skip-duplicate` preserves
the existing Marketplace version and allows the GitHub release assets to be
created. It does not replace an existing Marketplace package. Publish changed
runtime code under a new version and tag.

If publishing fails because the policy is missing or mismatched, fix its exact
owner/repository/workflow values and rerun the failed publish job. The SHA-256
check ensures it consumes the saved build artifact. If that artifact has expired,
rerun the entire workflow for the same immutable tag. A manual workflow run on a
branch only tests and packages; selecting an existing version tag also publishes.
